# Buildspace Solidity + Smart Contracts Project

Created this app as part of a Buildspace course. To use it, connect your Metamask wallet, and use the Rinkeby testnet to sign transactions. (You can get free Rinkeby from a faucet like this: https://app.mycrypto.com/faucet, no ETH gas fees required.)
